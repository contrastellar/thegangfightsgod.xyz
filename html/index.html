        <h2 id="ew-relic">Endwalker Relic</h2>
        <p>
            This one's gonna be a doozy if you haven't already done the Hildibrand quests.<br><br>
            You're gonna wanna start off with the "The Rise and Fall of Gentlemen" given by <i>Wymond</i> in (I'm gonna guess) Ul'dah.
            Complete *all of the quests*. I cannot stress this enough. All of them. Until the end of "The Imperfect Gentleman". You'll know, 
            as the game will tell you that Godbert wants to talk to you about something!
        </p>
        <p>
            From there, you'll be walked through some stuff. But, ideally you have 1500 Tomestones of Astronomy (That's the red ones).
            Trade those in to <i>Jubrunnah</i> in Radz-at-Han (near the aetheryte). Head back to Gerolt, and continue forward.
            That's it for the start. Sorry bud.

        <h2 id="vd-cd">Variant Dungeons and Criterion Dungeons</h2>
        <p>
            Variant Dungeons have branching paths with various stories to discover. I'd be willing to bet this is on a weekly basis.
            Criterion Dungeons are 'more difficult' dungeons set in the Sil'dihn Subterrane, with a different reward pool and different currency to turn in.

            Both version's currency can be turned in at <i>Trisassant</i> in Old Sharlyan (12.0, 13.3).
