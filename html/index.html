            This one's gonna be a doozy if you haven't already done the Hildibrand quests.<br><br>
            You're gonna wanna start off with the "The Rise and Fall of Gentlemen" given by <i>Wymond</i> in (I'm gonna guess) Ul'dah.
            Complete *all of the quests*. I cannot stress this enough. All of them. Until the end of "The Imperfect Gentleman". You'll know, 
            as the game will tell you that Godbert wants to talk to you about something!
        </p>
        <p>
            From there, you'll be walked through some stuff. But, ideally you have 1500 Tomestones of Astronomy (That's the red ones).
            Trade those in to <i>Jubrunnah</i> in Radz-at-Han (near the aetheryte). Head back to Gerolt, and continue forward.
            That's it for the start. Sorry bud.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second phase involves another short quest, but another 1500 Tomestones of Astronomy (The red ones).
            Trade those into <i>Jubrunnah</i> in Radz-at-Han (near the aetheryte). Head back to Gerolt, and continue waiting like the rest of us!

        <h2 id="vcd">Variant Dungeons and Criterion Dungeons</h2>
        <p>
            <h3 id="vcd-help">okay but what like what the heck are they?</h3>
            In 6.25, Variant and Criterion Dungeons were added.
            Variant Dungeons have an evolving story, with a story NPC. Variant dungeons' main attraction is the branching paths where the player character and their party can pick and choose which paths to take or not to take. There isn't a weekly lockout, as people have already catalogued the first NPC's worth of story.<br><br>

            Speaking of the NPC--<br>
            The NPC for the start of the Variant Dungeon story is <a href="https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Nanamo_Ul_Namo">Nanamo Ul Namo.</a> You may wanna brush up on your Ul'dah history as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3 id="vcd-gameplay">gameplay</h3>
            Variant Dungeons have branching paths with various stories to discover with an associated NPC. They permit changing what job you're playing when out of combat in the dungeon, and also you can pick Variant Actions (similar to Eureka, and Bozja), which can be used for things like healing, emnity generation, or DPS.<br><br>

            Criterion Dungeons are 'more difficult' dungeons set in the Sil'dihn Subterrane, with a different reward pool and different currency to turn in for those rewards. Criterion dungeons do not permit role changes, nor do they have selectable Variant Actions. It is locked to just the action <u>Variant Raise II</u><br><br>

            Both the Variant and Criterion currency can be turned in at <i>Trisassant</i> in Old Sharlyan (12.0, 13.3).

        <h2 id="plugins">contra's guide to plugins</h2>
        <p>
            Let's be honest.<br>
            A lot of people use plugins. But what is a plugin? How do <i>you</i> use them?
            Simple!
            <a href="https://github.com/goatcorp/FFXIVQuickLauncher">The FFXIV Quick Launcher!</a> Give this a download, then come back here.<br><br>
            ...<br><br>
            Did you download it?
            Good!
            Use it to log in, and it'll do some fun stuff.
            Once you're in game on a character you like, go ahead and type
            <div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">/xlplugins</div><br>
            into the chatbox!
            ...
            This will bring up the plugin manager!
        </p>
        <p>
            You need these plugins if you'd like to do modding of any sort. Go into your plugin menu, click settings, click experimental, scroll down. Paste one of these per line.
